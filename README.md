# Cookiecutter: FastAPI template 

## Quick Start
First, install cookiecutter if you don't already have it:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Second, install docker-compose if you don't already have it:

<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose installation official docs.</a>


Then, in the directory you want your project to live:
```
gh:VIILLAKC/FastAPI-_Template
```

You will need to put in a few variables and it will create a project directory (called whatever you set for project_slug).

<a href="{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}\README.md">DEVELOP</a>

## Credits

This project was inspired by and uses code from [<a href="https://github.com/Buuntu/fastapi-react/tree/master">fastapi-react</a>], a publicly archived repository by [<a href="https://github.com/Buuntu">Gabriel Abud</a>]. I appreciate the original author and the community that contributed to that project.
